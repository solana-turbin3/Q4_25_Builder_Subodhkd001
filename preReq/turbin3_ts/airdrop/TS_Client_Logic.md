### Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side development? 

There can be multiple reasons for choosing typescript for client side development on solana, some of them are - 

1. `Type safety` : TypeScript checks your code before you even run it, so you catch silly errors early. When you’re dealing with blockchains, one small mistake can waste money or fail a transaction.

2. `Familiar to web developers`: Most people building apps already knew JavaScript/TypeScript. Since Solana wanted lots of developers to join in, it made sense to use a language they were already comfortable with.

3. `Works great with Solana tools`: The main Solana library (web3.js) and Anchor (a popular tool for Solana smart contracts) are built in TypeScript. That means everything connects smoothly without extra effort.

4. `Better experience`: TypeScript gives you autocomplete, hints, and suggestions while coding. That saves time and reduces frustration.

5. `Runs everywhere`: TypeScript turns into JavaScript, so the same code can run in a browser (for dApps) or on a server (for bots, scripts, backends).

6. `Community effect`: Since some of the earlist projects on Solana used TypeScript, more and more people followed along. It became the “default” choice.
